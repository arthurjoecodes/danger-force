<h3>the life</h3>
<p>
It has been three weeks since Captain Man and Kid Danger have defeated Drex. With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says "but." The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison so that he can get the monkey he owes Crank. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys.

As the Danger Force agrees with Captain Man that they need more training, Frankini keeps going around due to the 75 costumes that he smuggled into Swellview Prison.

<h3>the career</h3>
<p>
Captain Man explains to Trent and Mary about the incident at Swellview Prison and introduces the Danger Force who have not found any of the escaped villains yet. Chapa, Mika, Miles, and Bose have been referred to as Spicy Milk, Oopsie Girl, Wing Wimp, and Gorgeous Hair Boy when the disastrous interview goes viral. They want to be referred to as Volt, AWOL, Shout-Out, and Brainstorm. Schwoz states if the news uses their dumb name three times, it will stick. Captain Man stated that he got his name said three times thanks to a DJ named Coyote Jake. Their first attempt to get their right names said is to get a toddler that Bose mistook for Toddler named Ellis back to his parents. Mika and Miles go to Hip Hop Puree to meet a vlogger named Natalie Mazdah who sat on the same airplane that Emma Watson rode where they plan to get her to say the names of their superhero forms three times. When the Danger Force tries to get her to say their name, Hip Hop Pureee is visited by the Toddler and his henchmen. As their powers haven't been perfected, the Danger Force struggles to defeat the Toddler and his men until they use spicy milk on them. After the Toddler flees, Ellis' dads arrive to pick up Ellis who calls the Danger Force by their real superhero names. Natalie does a viral video as Trent and Mary finally say the names three times which pleases the Danger Force.

The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning, Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting. As Ray didn't get any sleep, Schwoz warns them that he will turn bad if he doesn't get enough sleep. This causes Ray to plot to use a mayonaise container filled with flesh-eating bacteria at them. Chapa, Mika, Miles, and Bose work to keep Percy and Miriam safe from an exhausted Ray. The mayonnaise container breaks on Ray as Shapen comes in after obtaining an opening in a Bordertown school for poor gifted children. As she takes Percy and Miriam away, Shapen states that the school can keep its license as she will not send any other children here. Miles stated that the solution provided itself as Mika had been the one who filled out the applications for them.
Captain Man reads down the crimes as Danger Force retaliates when they hear that somebody stole books from the Swellview Library except for the books written by Captain Man. Shout-Out states that they can disguise themselves as villains in order to infiltrate Villains' Night at The Beating Dungeon to see if any of them stole the library books. Schwoz provides them with villainous disguises to infiltrate The Beating Dungeon. Captain Man becomes Hawkfist, Volt becomes El Stabbador, AWOL becomes Weird Beard, Shout-Out becomes Mangler, and Brainstorm becomes a Yerban Santa Claus.
