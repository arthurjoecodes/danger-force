<h3><em><strong>the life</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
It has been three weeks since Captain Man and Kid Danger have defeated Drex. With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says "but." The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man.

<h3><em><strong>the career</strong></em></h3>
<p>

Captain Man explains to Trent and Mary about the incident at Swellview Prison and introduces the Danger Force who have not found any of the escaped villains yet. Chapa, Mika, Miles, and Bose have been referred to as Spicy Milk, Oopsie Girl, Wing Wimp, and Gorgeous Hair Boy when the disastrous interview goes viral. They want to be referred to as Volt, AWOL, Shout-Out, and Brainstorm. Schwoz states if the news uses their dumb name three times, it will stick. Captain Man stated that he got his name said three times thanks to a DJ named Coyote Jake. Their first attempt to get their right names said is to get a toddler that Bose mistook for Toddler named Ellis back to his parents. Mika and Miles go to Hip Hop Puree to meet a vlogger named Natalie Mazdah who sat on the same airplane that Emma Watson rode where they plan to get her to say the names of their superhero forms three times.

The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning, Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting. As Ray didn't get any sleep, Schwoz warns them that he will turn bad if he doesn't get enough sleep. This causes Ray to plot to use a mayonaise container filled with flesh-eating bacteria at them. Chapa, Mika, Miles, and Bose work to keep Percy and Miriam safe from an exhausted Ray. The mayonnaise container breaks on Ray as Shapen comes in after obtaining an opening in a Bordertown school for poor gifted children. As she takes Percy and Miriam away, Shapen states that the school can keep its license as she will not send any other children here. Miles stated that the solution provided itself as Mika had been the one who filled out the applications for them.
Captain Man reads down the crimes as Danger Force retaliates when they hear that somebody stole books from the Swellview Library except for the books written by Captain Man. Shout-Out states that they can disguise themselves as villains in order to infiltrate Villains' Night at The Beating Dungeon to see if any of them stole the library books.

Shout-Out gives herself away when she screams at Book-Thievin' Steven for what he does to the books as the villains converge on her. Captain Man as Hawkfist (where he keeps changing his name to Hawkules and Talented Mr. Hawkly) uses a doughnut to fake a bleeding to take her down until Betty Blades identifies the blood as raspberry jelly which disappointed the villains. The rest of Danger Force gives themselves away as Ray sneaks off to become Captain Man in order to fight the villains. Captain Man and Danger Force fight the villains and defeat the villains as Book-Thievin' Steven is apprehended. At Volt's suggestion, Captain Man tortures Book-Thievin' Steven by reading all the chapters of his book.
Captain Man and Danger Force are going to Paris because Captain Man's French counterpart Monsieur Man is on strike until someone buys him a pink motorcycle. Because of this, they have to cover for Monsieur Man in protecting France's national treasures until Monsieur Man returns to his job.

To get the mime artist cooperate, Shout-Out plays along with the mime artist. Getting into the Man Nest, Toddler tries to call the news as Bose's destroyed stuffed animal Boom Boom Pew-Pew tries to tell him to turn on the security system. After the mime artist's performance, Monsieur Man mocks them as the mime group that Captain Man suspected to have been associated with the mime with them arrive. Danger Force breaks free as Captain Man fights the Mime Queen as they fight off the mimes. Monsieur Man goes back to work when he finally gets his pink motorcycle. Bose finally activates the security system to trap Toddler and Goomer. Back in France, the mimes are trapped at the cost of France's national treasures while Schwoz finally found a love interest for a few minutes as they take their leave from France.
Trent and Mary cover the news via Zoom about a way-too natural gas leak from the nearby Bhutt Factory happens in Swellview causing everyone to stay at home under Vice-Mayor Willard's orders. Its current owner Harold Bhutt stated that an intruder was responsible. Even Danger Force is setting a good example as they do things to await the quarantine to be lifted with Chapa not being able to do anything with her phone still stolen.

Toddler claims that someone else did it. Dr. Minyak is selling stuff online as he is contacted by Captain Man and Toddler with the latter states he originally smelled it. Captain Man then uses his Punch-Through Screen to beat up Toddler and Dr. Minyak. Danger Force is advised to transform and contact every criminals on line. Donning their quarantine items, Danger Force makes contact with Frankini who reveals that he leaked the gas from the Bhutt Factory while waiting for them to figure out he did it because he wanted to be in a celebrity uplifting music video where people perform it are in a state of despair. Captain Man joins the contact and learns of Frankini's motives. This leads to a music video performance of "This Gas Will Pass" done by Captain Man, Danger Force, Frankini, and Schwoz. Afterwards, Frankini does his part of the deal by meeting Captain Man at the Bhutt Factory to close up the gas leak while everyone does the Clik-Clok dance.
